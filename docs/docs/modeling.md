## Modeling 
- What are the Common price amount always happening for the given list of variables(x-var)? 
    - This is useful to get a intiution 
    - This can be used in final stage of modeling (we can tweak the model output , to get desired output at the last)
- Feature Selection using trained models
- Build Different Algorithms to predict the price
    - Linear, Lasso,Ridge
    - Xgboost,Catboost,LightGBM
    - Pytorch model (if needed)
	- Baseline model performance metrics
- Measure the model performance using 
    - Mean Absolute Error
    - Mean Squared Error
    - RMSE
- Benchmark Leaderboard of models using Different Hyperparameters
    - For above metrics(Error function in the test set)
    - Also for Prediction Time
	
- Confidence Interval Calculation 
    - Random Forest Confidence Intervals (using different Decision Trees)
    - Gradient Boosting using Quantile Intervals
- Explanation for the prediction
    - Shap
    - Lime
